# CSRF Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
Users were encountering "CSRF verification failed" errors when trying to log in, especially after a failed login attempt.

## Root Cause
Django rotates CSRF tokens after login attempts (both successful and failed) for security reasons. When a user tries to log in again without refreshing the page, the old CSRF token is no longer valid, causing a 403 Forbidden error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom CSRF Failure View
Created `/users/csrf_views.py` that:
- Catches CSRF failures gracefully
- Shows a user-friendly message: "Your session has expired. Please try again."
- Redirects to the login page with a fresh CSRF token
- Logs the error for debugging

### 2. Updated Settings
Added to `core/settings.py`:
```python
CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW = 'users.csrf_views.csrf_failure'
```

### 3. Enhanced Login Template
Updated `templates/account/login.html` with JavaScript to:
- Detect CSRF error redirects
- Show a friendly warning message
- Clean up URL parameters

## How It Works Now

**Before:**
1. User tries to log in with wrong credentials
2. CSRF token is rotated
3. User tries again → **403 CSRF Error** (confusing!)

**After:**
1. User tries to log in with wrong credentials
2. CSRF token is rotated
3. User tries again → CSRF failure is caught
4. User is redirected to login page with fresh token
5. Friendly message shown: "Your session has expired. Please try again."
6. User can now log in successfully ✅

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Go to login page
2. Enter wrong credentials
3. Try to log in again
4. You should see a friendly message instead of a 403 error
5. The page will have a fresh CSRF token
6. Login should work on the next attempt

## Files Modified

- ✅ `users/csrf_views.py` (NEW)
- ✅ `core/settings.py` (Added CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW)
- ✅ `templates/account/login.html` (Added CSRF error handling JS)
- ✅ `users/login_views.py` (Simplified error handling)

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - No more confusing 403 errors
2. **Automatic Recovery** - Users are automatically redirected with a fresh token
3. **Clear Messaging** - Users understand what happened
4. **Logging** - CSRF failures are logged for debugging
5. **Security Maintained** - CSRF protection still works as intended

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The CSRF error handling is now production-ready!
