## ‚úÖ Verify It's Working:

### Method 1: Check Render Logs
1. Go to **Logs** tab in Render dashboard
2. Look for this line:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Email configured: Real emails will be sent via SMTP
   ```
3. If you see this instead, it's NOT working yet:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Email not configured: Emails will be printed to console
   ```

### Method 2: Test Password Reset
1. Go to: https://ai-resume-builder-6jan.onrender.com/accounts/password/reset/
2. Enter email: `mpandat0052@gmail.com`
3. Click "Send OTP Code"
4. Check your email inbox (should receive OTP within 1-2 minutes)

## ‚ùì FAQ:

**Q: Why didn't this work before?**
A: Environment variables in `.env` file are not deployed to Render. They must be added manually in Render dashboard.

**Q: Is my email password secure?**
A: Yes! This is a Gmail App Password (not your real password). It's secure and can only be used for email sending.

**Q: How long does it take for changes to apply?**
A: After saving in Render, redeploy takes 2-3 minutes. Then test immediately.

**Q: What if I still don't receive OTP?**
A: Check:
1. Render logs show "Email configured" 
2. Spam/Junk folder
3. Gmail App Password is still active
4. All 5 variables are spelled correctly (no typos)
